# Help

## Cairo Installation

Refer to the [exercism help page][help-page] for Cairo installation and learning
resources.

## Submitting the solution

Generally you should submit all files in which you implemented your solution (`src/lib.cairo` in most cases). If you are using any external crates, please consider submitting the `Scarb.toml` file. This will make the review process faster and clearer.

## Feedback, Issues, Pull Requests

The GitHub [track repository][github] is the home for all of the Cairo exercises. If you have feedback about an exercise, or want to help implement new exercises, head over there and create an issue. Members of the Cairo track team are happy to help!

If you want to know more about Exercism, take a look at the [contribution guide].

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
