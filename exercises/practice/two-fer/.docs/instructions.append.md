## Option Enum

In Cairo, the `Option` enumeration is used to represent the concept of a value being absent or present.

There are two variants:
- `Option::None` takes no asssociated value and represents no data being present.
- `Option::Some` takes an associated value and represents that value being represented like `Option::Some(value)`.
