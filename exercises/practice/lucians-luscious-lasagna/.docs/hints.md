# Hints

## General

- An integer literal can be defined as one or more consecutive digits.

## 1. Define the expected oven time in minutes

- You need to define a [function][functions] without any parameters.

## 2. Calculate the remaining oven time in minutes

- You need to define a [function][functions] with a single parameter.
- You can use and refer to the previously defined item by its name.
- The last expression in a function is [automatically returned][return-values]
  from the function; you don't have to explicitly indicate which value to
  return.
- You can use the [mathematical operator for subtraction][operators] to
  subtract values.

## 3. Calculate the preparation time in minutes

- You need to define a [function][functions] with a single parameter.
- You can use the [mathematical operator for multiplication][operators] to
  multiply values.

## 4. Calculate the elapsed time in minutes

- You need to define a [function][functions] with two parameters.
- You can [call][functions] one of the other functions you've defined
  previously.
- You can use the [mathematical operator for addition][operators] to add
  values.
