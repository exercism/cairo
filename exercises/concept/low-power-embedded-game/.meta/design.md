# Design

## Goal

Introduce the student to tuples and how to work with them. Understand that traits can be automatically generated from an implementation.

## Learning objectives

- know how to create tuples and tuple structs
- know how to destructure tuples into new variables, e.g. `let (x, y) = a_point;`;
- see that traits can be automatically generated by the compiler if the `impl` is annotated with the `#[generate_trait]` attribute.

## Out of scope

- enum variants with tuple structs

## Concepts

- tuples
- destructuring
- traits

## Prerequisites

- traits
