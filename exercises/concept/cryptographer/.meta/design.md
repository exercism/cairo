# Design

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to teach the student how to work with `felt252` (field elements) in Cairo, with a focus on basic arithmetic operations and division.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how addition and subtraction with field elements are performed within the range of a large prime number $P$.
- Learn how division works in the context of finite fields, ensuring the result satisfies the equation $(\frac{x}{y} \cdot y = x)$.
  
## Out of Scope

- Multiplication beyond basic field element multiplication.
- Handling more complex operations or edge cases involving $P$.

## Concepts

The Concepts this exercise unlocks are:

- `felts`

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of data types in Cairo.
- Familiarity with modular arithmetic.
