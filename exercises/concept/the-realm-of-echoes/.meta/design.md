# Design

## Goal

Introduce students to the use of formatting traits like `Display` and `Debug` and how to concatenate strings effectively using the `format!` macro.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and implement the `Display` trait for custom types.
- Understand and implement the `Debug` trait for custom types.
- Learn how to use the `format!` macro to concatenate strings and format output.
- Explore the differences between the `Display` and `Debug` traits in formatting.

## Out of Scope

- Advanced string manipulation techniques.
- Error handling mechanisms beyond basic usage.
- Interaction with non-primitive custom types within formatting.

## Concepts

- printing

## Prerequisites

- traits
- strings
- structs
