# Design

## Goal

Teach students about operator overloading in Cairo through implementing custom operators for a struct.

## Learning objectives

- Understand how to implement the `Add` trait for custom addition
- Understand how to implement the `Sub` trait for custom subtraction
- Learn about deriving `PartialEq` for equality comparison
- Understand how to implement `PartialOrd` for comparison operations
- Learn about operator overloading in Cairo

## Out of scope

- Complex arithmetic operations
- Custom error handling
- Generic implementations
- Multiple parameter types

## Concepts

- Operator overloading
- Derived traits

## Prerequisites

- Generic types
