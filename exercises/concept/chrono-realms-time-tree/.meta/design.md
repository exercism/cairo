# Design

## Goal

Introduce the student to working with recursive types and smart pointers in Cairo.

## Learning objectives

- Understand how to define and use recursive types with enums in Cairo.
- Learn how to use smart pointers (`Box<T>`) for handling recursive data structures.
- Practice working with recursive functions to traverse and manipulate linked data.

## Out of scope

- Advanced memory management concepts related to smart pointers beyond `Box<T>`.
- Deep dive into optimization of recursive data structures.

## Concepts

- Enums
- Recursive types
- Smart pointers (`Box<T>`)

## Prerequisites

- Traits
- Basic understanding of enums and data types in Cairo.
- Familiarity with smart pointers in Cairo.
