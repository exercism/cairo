# Hints

## General

## 1. Implement the `new()` method

- The `new()` method receives the arguments we want to instantiate a `User` instance with.
  It should return an instance of `User` with the specified name, age, and weight.

- See [here][structs] for additional examples on defining and instantiating structs.

## 2. Implement the getter methods

- The `name()`, `age()`, and `weight()` methods are getters.
  In other words, they are responsible for returning the corresponding field from a struct instance.

- There's no need to use a `return` statement in Cairo unless you expressly want a function or method to return early.
  Otherwise, it's more idiomatic to utilize an _implicit_ return by omitting the semicolon for the result we want a function or method to return.
  It's not _wrong_ to use an explicit return, but it's cleaner to take advantage of implicit returns where possible.

```rust
fn foo() -> i32 {
    1
}
```

- See [here][methods] for some more examples of defining methods on structs.

## 3. Implement the setter methods

- The `set_age()` and `set_weight()` methods are setters, responsible for updating the corresponding field on a struct instance with the input argument.

- As the signatures of these methods specify, the setter methods shouldn't return anything.
