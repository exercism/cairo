- Know how to convert between signed and unsigned integers safely.
- Know how to implement the `Into` trait for custom types.
- Understand when conversions can fail and how to handle them with `Option`.

## Out of scope

- `TryFrom` trait implementations.
- Complex generic trait bounds.
- Advanced trait derivation.
- Performance implications of conversions.

## Concepts

- Type conversions

## Prerequisites

- Enums (Option)
- Pattern matching
