# Instructions

A friend of yours has an old wholesale store called **Gross Store**.

The name comes from the quantity of the item that the store sell: it's all in [gross unit][gross-unit].

Your friend asked you to implement a point of sale (POS) system for his store.

**First, you want to build a prototype for it.**

**In your prototype, your system will only record the quantity.**

Your friend gave you a list of measurements to help you:

| Unit               | Score |
| ------------------ | ----- |
| quarter_of_a_dozen | 3     |
| half_of_a_dozen    | 6     |
| dozen              | 12    |
| small_gross        | 120   |
| gross              | 144   |
| great_gross        | 1728  |

## 1. Store the unit of measurement in your program

In order to use the measurement, you need to store the measurement in your program.

```rust
let units = units();
// Felt252Dictionary with entries like { 'dozen': 12 }
```

## 2. Create a new customer bill

You need to implement a function that create a new (empty) bill for the customer.

```rust
let bill = new_bill();
// Empty Felt252Dictionary
```

## 3. Add an item to the customer bill

To implement this, you'll need to:

- Return `false` if the given `unit` is not in the `units` map.
- Otherwise add the item to the customer `bill`, indexed by the item name, then return `true`.
- If the item is already present in the bill, increase its quantity by the amount that belongs to the provided `unit`.

```rust
let bill = new_bill();
let units = units();
let ok = add_item(bill, units, 'carrot', 'dozen');
println!(ok);
// Output: true (since dozen is a valid unit)
```

> Note that the returned value is type `bool`.

## 4. Remove an item from the customer bill

To implement this, you'll need to:

- Return `false` if the given item is **not** in the bill.
An item is considered to not be in the bill if its quantity is 0.
- Return `false` if the given `unit` is not in the `units` map.
- Return `false` if the new quantity would be less than 0.
- If the new quantity is 0, the item is considered removed from the `bill`, so you can return `true`.
- Otherwise, reduce the quantity of the item and return `true`.

```rust
let bill = new_bill();
let units = units();
let ok = remove_item(bill, units, 'carrot', 'dozen');
println!(ok);
// Output: false (because there are no carrots in the bill)
```

> Note that the returned value is type `bool`.

## 5. Return the quantity of a specific item that is in the customer bill

```rust
let mut bill: Felt252Dict<u32> = Default::default();
bill.insert('carrot', 12);
bill.insert('grapes', 3);
let qty = get_item(bill, 'carrot');
println!(qty);
// Output: 12
```

> Note that the returned value is type `u32`.
