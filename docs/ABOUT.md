<!-- TODO: write document

  This document contains a short introduction to the language.

  The introduction should be relatively brief and touch upon what
  makes the language interesting (and possibly unique). The goal
  is to help students decide if they want to join this track.

  The contents of this document are displayed on the track page,
  provided the student has not joined the track.

  See https://exercism.org/docs/building/tracks/docs for more information. -->
