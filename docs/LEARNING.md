# Learning

Cairo is the first Turing-complete language for creating provable programs for general computation. It is a Rust-like high-level language. Like Rust, it is intended to allow developers to easily write code that is efficient and safe. Cairo is particularly well-suited for use in a permissionless network like [Starknet](https://www.starknet.io/), where it can provide robust DoS protection and censorship resistance.

We think the best way to learn is to play and to practice, either by creating your own coding projects, or by solving small problems like the ones here on Exercism!

Below are some resources that might help you jumpstart your Cairo journey:

* [The Cairo Book](https://book.cairo-lang.org/) is a great resource for getting started with Cairo as well as diving deeper into specific features of Cairo.
* [Cairo Documentation](https://docs.cairo-lang.org/) explains the language's constructs and semantics.
* [Cairo by Example](https://cairo-by-example.com/) shows you examples of the most common things you will be writing in Cairo.
* [Node Guardians](https://nodeguardians.io/campaigns?f=3%3D2) "A fantasy themed learning platform for Smart Contract developers."
* [Starknet by Example](https://starknet-by-example.voyager.online/) a collection of examples of how to use the Cairo programming language to create smart contracts on Starknet.
* [Starklings](https://github.com/carols10cents/rustlings) "A web-based interactive tutorial to learn Cairo and Starknet."
* [Awesome Starknet](https://github.com/keep-starknet-strange/awesome-starknet) "A curated list of awesome StarkNet resources, libraries, tools and more".
* The [Cairo Community Forum](https://community.cairo-lang.org/) answers questions of all levels.
