# Learning

Cairo is the first Turing-complete language for creating provable programs for general computation. It is a Rust-like high-level language. Like Rust, it is intended to allow developers to easily write code that is efficient and safe.

We think the best way to learn is to play and to practice, either by creating your own coding projects, or by solving small problems like the ones here on Exercism!

Below are some resources that might help you jumpstart your Cairo journey:

- [Cairo Programming Language](https://www.cairo-lang.org/) introduces the Cairo language and lists many relevant resources to learn and use Cairo.
- [The Cairo Book](https://book.cairo-lang.org/) is a great resource for learning Cairo as well as diving deeper into specific features of Cairo.
- [Cairo Documentation](https://docs.cairo-lang.org/) explains the language's constructs and semantics.
- [Cairo by Example](https://cairo-by-example.com/) shows you examples of the most common things you will be writing in Cairo.
- [Node Guardians](https://nodeguardians.io/campaigns?f=3%3D2) "A fantasy themed learning platform for Smart Contract developers."
- The [Cairo Community Forum](https://community.cairo-lang.org/) answers questions of all levels.
