Cairo is particularly well-suited for use in a permissionless network like [Starknet](https://www.starknet.io/), where it can provide robust DoS protection and censorship resistance. It might be interesting to learn about this aspect of the language. Learning to create Starknet smart contracts will improve your mastery of Cairo as you would be solving real world problems with the language, and it would also introduce you to the world of Web3.

* [Starknet Documentation](https://docs.starknet.io/) learn what Starknet is, how it works and how to develop smart contracts on it.
* [Starknet by Example](https://starknet-by-example.voyager.online/) a collection of examples of how to use the Cairo programming language to create smart contracts on Starknet.
