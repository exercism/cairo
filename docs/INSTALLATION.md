Having the toolchain installed is not everything! IDE support is a huge productivity boost that most developers have come to expect.
If you are using Visual Studio Code, we recommend you install the [Cairo extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=starkware.cairo1), which provides syntax highlighting, code completion, and other useful features!
