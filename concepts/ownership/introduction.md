# Introduction

In Cairo, the concept of ownership applies to _variables_ and defines the rules governing who can use those variables.
Each declared variable can only be used once, meaning that once a variable is used, it will either be destroyed or moved, depending on the type of usage.

_Destruction_ can happen in several ways:

- a variable goes out of scope (with/without usage).
- a struct is destructured.
- explicit destruction using `destruct()`

_Moving_ a value simply means passing that value to another function.

The Cairo language uses a linear type system, which it leverages to ensure that all code is provable (and verifiable) alongside abstracting away the immutable memory of the Cairo VM.
