# Introduction

An [`Array`][Array] are fixed-size sequences of elements of the same data type. Unlike [`lists`][List], which are dynamic and can hold elements of various types, arrays are homogeneous collections that are more memory-efficient for storing large sets of data when the type is known beforehand. Arrays can be of multiple dimensions, with the simplest form being one-dimensional arrays
