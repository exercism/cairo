# Introduction

Associated implementations in Cairo allow you to enforce relationships between types and their trait implementations, ensuring type safety and consistency.
By specifying that an associated type must implement a particular trait, you create a strong, compile-time guarantee that the necessary functionality is provided.
This feature is especially useful for building modular, extensible, and type-safe abstractions.
