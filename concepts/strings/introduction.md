# Introduction

In Cairo, there's no native type for strings.
Instead, you can use a single `felt252` to store a short string of up to 31 characters, or a `ByteArray` for strings of arbitrary length.
Short strings use single quotes and `ByteArray` uses double quotes.
All characters must follow the ASCII standard.
