Functions in Cairo let you organize and reuse code by defining reusable blocks with a name, parameters, and an optional return value.
They consist of statements and expressions, where the latter can produce a value.
Learning how to define, call, and work with parameters and return values is key to writing clean and efficient Cairo programs.
