# Introduction

Smart pointers in Cairo are special data structures that manage memory safely by ensuring that memory is accessed in a controlled way.
They act like regular pointers but include additional features like ownership rules and metadata to prevent common errors, such as dereferencing uninitialized memory.
This makes them essential for working with complex data structures and improving program safety and performance.
