# Introduction

Generics in Cairo allow us to write flexible and reusable code that works with multiple data types, reducing duplication and improving maintainability.
By introducing generic parameters in functions, structs, enums, and traits, we can define abstractions that adapt to different concrete types while enforcing constraints, such as trait bounds, for compile-time safety.
