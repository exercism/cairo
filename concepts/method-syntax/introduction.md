# Introduction

In Cairo, methods and associated functions allow you to organize functionality around specific types, making your code modular and intuitive.
Methods operate on an instance of a type and always include `self` as their first parameter, while associated functions, such as constructors, donâ€™t require an instance.
Together, they enable a clean and structured approach to defining behavior and utilities for your types.
