# Introduction

Control flow in Cairo, through constructs like `if` expressions and loops, allows developers to direct the execution of their programs based on conditional logic or repetitive tasks.
`if` expressions enable branching based on whether conditions evaluate to `true` or `false`, while loops (`loop`, `while`, `for`) facilitate repeated execution of code blocks until specific criteria are met.
These constructs are crucial for implementing logic, iteration, and handling multiple conditions concisely, making them essential tools for writing efficient and dynamic code in Cairo.
