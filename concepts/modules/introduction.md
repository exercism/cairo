# Introduction

In Cairo, modules help organize code by grouping related functions, structs, and traits into separate namespaces.
The `use` keyword simplifies access to these items by bringing them into scope, reducing repetition when calling functions or using types.
This section covers best practices for structuring modules, importing items efficiently, and re-exporting for cleaner and more maintainable code.
