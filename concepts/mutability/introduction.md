# Introduction

Cairo uses an immutable memory model, which means that once a memory cell is written to, it can't be changed. With this standard, variables are immutable by default. However, Cairo provides a mechanism to create mutable variables using the `mut` keyword when needed, offering flexibility while maintaining the benefits of immutability.
