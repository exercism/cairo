# Introduction

Operator overloading in Cairo enables you to redefine standard operators like `+` and `-` for custom types by implementing specific traits.
This allows user-defined types to interact intuitively with operators, similar to primitive types.
When used thoughtfully, operator overloading enhances code readability and expressiveness while preserving clarity and intent.
