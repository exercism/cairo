# Introduction

Integers are whole numbers with no decimal separator.

Integer types can either store only positive numbers (unsigned) or store either positive and negative numbers (signed).

Examples are -6, 0, 1, 25 and 976.

Note that you can use underscores to improve the readability of longer numbers: `1_000_000`.
