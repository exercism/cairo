# Integer Types

An `integer` is a number without a fractional component. In Cairo, the type declaration for integers indicates the number of bits the programmer can use to store the value.

Unsigned integers can only represent positive numbers and the number 0 (zero), which can be beneficial in certain programming contexts, such as array indexing and memory management.

Cairo also provides support for signed integers, starting with the prefix `i`. These integers can represent both positive and negative values, with sizes ranging from `i8` to `i128`. Each signed variant can store numbers from $-2^{n-1}$ to $2^{n-1} - 1$ inclusive, where $n$ is the number of bits that variant uses.
For example, an `i8` can store numbers from $-2^7$ to $2^7 - 1$, which equals $-128$ to $127$.

| Length   | Unsigned | Signed |
|----------|----------|----------|
| 8-bit    | u8       | i8       |
| 16-bit   | u16      | i16      |
| 32-bit   | u32      | i32      |
| 64-bit   | u64      | i64      |
| 128-bit  | u128     | i128     |
| 256-bit  | u256     | ------   |

There is also a special integer type called `usize`, which is currently just an alias for `u32`. This type might play a more distinct role in the future, once Cairo can be compiled to MLIR (Multi-Level Intermediate Representation).

## Integer Literals in Cairo

You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in the below table. Note that number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a type suffix, such as `57_u8`, to designate the type. It is also possible to use a visual separator `_` for number literals, in order to improve code readability.

| Numeric Literals | Example |
| ---------------- | ------- |
| Decimal          | 98222   |
| Hex              | 0xff    |
| Octal            | 0o04321 |
| Binary           | 0b01    |

So how do you know which type of integer to use? Try to estimate the max value your int can have and choose the appropriate size. The primary situation in which you’d use `usize` is when indexing some sort of collection.

## Numeric Operations

Cairo supports the basic mathematical operations you’d expect for all the integer types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder. Integer division truncates toward zero to the nearest integer. The following code shows how you’d use each numeric operation in a `let` statement:

```rust
fn main() {
    // addition
    let sum = 5_u128 + 10_u128;

    // subtraction
    let difference = 95_u128 - 4_u128;

    // multiplication
    let product = 4_u128 * 30_u128;

    // division
    let quotient = 56_u128 / 32_u128; // result is 1
    let quotient = 64_u128 / 32_u128; // result is 2

    // remainder
    let remainder = 43_u128 % 5_u128; // result is 3
}
```

Each expression in these statements uses a mathematical operator and evaluates to a single value, which is then bound to a variable.
