Hi. &nbsp;üëãüèΩ &nbsp;üëã &nbsp;**We are happy you are here.**&nbsp; üéâ&nbsp;üåü

<br>

**`exercism/cairo`** is one of many programming language tracks on [exercism(dot)org][exercism-website].
This repo holds all the instructions, tests, code, & support files for Cairo _exercises_ currently under development or implemented & available for students.

Some Exercism language tracks have a **syllabus** which is meant to teach the language step-by-step.
The Cairo track's syllabus is a work in progress and it's not activated yet.
All exercises presented to students are **practice exercises**.
Students are expected to learn the language themselves, for example with the [official book][the-cairo-programming-language], and practice with our exercises.

## Testing

Tests currently use Cairo v2.8.2 (included with Scarb v2.8.2).

To test all exercises, run `./bin/verify-exercises`.
This command will iterate over all exercises and check to see if their exemplar/example implementation passes all the tests.

To test a single exercise, run `./bin/verify-exercises <exercise-slug>`.

### Track linting

[`configlet`](https://exercism.org/docs/building/configlet) is an Exercism-wide tool for working with tracks. You can download it by running:

```shell
$ ./bin/fetch-configlet
```

Run its [`lint` command](https://exercism.org/docs/building/configlet/lint) to verify if all exercises have all the necessary files and if config files are correct:

```shell
$ ./bin/configlet lint

The lint command is under development.
Please re-run this command regularly to see if your track passes the latest linting rules.

Basic linting finished successfully:
- config.json exists and is valid JSON
- config.json has these valid fields:
    language, slug, active, blurb, version, status, online_editor, key_features, tags
- Every concept has the required .md files
- Every concept has a valid links.json file
- Every concept has a valid .meta/config.json file
- Every concept exercise has the required .md files
- Every concept exercise has a valid .meta/config.json file
- Every practice exercise has the required .md files
- Every practice exercise has a valid .meta/config.json file
- Required track docs are present
- Required shared exercise docs are present
```
